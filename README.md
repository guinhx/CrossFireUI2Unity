# CrossFireUI2Unity
A small project that makes it possible to import the CrossFire FPS UI to Unity.


The project is still a prototype and may not be working properly, the overall goal is to be able to read the CrossFire UI/Scripts files and parse them.

With the main goal achieved, it will be possible to create real-time interfaces within the game using .txt scripts for both Canvas and Unity's UI Toolkit.
